# Generalized_Linear_Models

The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is a versatile and widely used framework for modeling various types of data. In this project, I focused on implementing the GLM algorithm with logistic regression, Poisson regression, and ordinal regression models. The aim was to analyze the learning behavior of the GLM algorithm by generating learning curves with error bars. The project was implemented using Python and using only NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries.

The GLM algorithm demonstrated effective learning behavior across the different likelihood models. The learning curves provided a comprehensive visualization of the error rates and convergence characteristics for various training set sizes. The results highlighted the performance of the GLM algorithm in accurately predicting outcomes based on the selected likelihood models.
